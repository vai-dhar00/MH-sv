# Cognitive Reframing (CBT Primer)

Cognitive reframing is a core technique in Cognitive Behavioral Therapy. It helps you spot unhelpful thoughts and gently challenge them.

## Step 1: Identify the Thought
- Notice a distressing thought (e.g. “I always mess up.”).

## Step 2: Examine the Evidence
- Ask yourself: What facts support this thought? What facts contradict it?

## Step 3: Generate Alternatives
- Brainstorm more balanced perspectives:
  - “I’ve done well in many situations before.”
  - “Mistakes help me learn.”

## Step 4: Choose a Balanced Thought
- Select one that feels realistic:
  > “I sometimes make mistakes, but I also handle many things quite well.”

> “Shifting perspective doesn’t ignore your feelings—it gives your mind more room to breathe.”
